This is an experimental version of the linkhandler extension that aims
to minimize the amount of duplicate code.

Additionally, all legacy code was removed, the goal is to provide
a version that is compatible with TYPO3 6.2.

Warning!
Some of the new features are still missing, like softrefs and the
modification of the "Save and show" button.
